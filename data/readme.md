The CSV files in this folder provide sample one-minute candlestick data for
BTC/USDT. Columns follow the standard Binance export format:

```
timestamp,open,high,low,close,volume,close_time,quote_asset_volume,
number_of_trades,taker_buy_base_asset_volume,taker_buy_quote_asset_volume,ignore
```

`timestamp` is in UTC and can be parsed with `pandas.read_csv` using
`parse_dates=True`. Example:

```python
import pandas as pd
price_series = pd.read_csv("BTCUSDT_1m_data.csv", index_col="timestamp", parse_dates=True)["close"]
```

## Source
The data was downloaded from the public Binance API via the `/api/v3/klines` endpoint for the `BTCUSDT` trading pair.
An example request is:
`https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines?symbol=BTCUSDT&interval=1m`.

## How the CSV files were generated
A simple Python script queried the Binance API and converted the returned JSON
records into CSV format. Each row in the file corresponds to a one-minute candle.
The script converted Unix timestamps to ISO 8601 strings and wrote the results
with the columns shown above.
